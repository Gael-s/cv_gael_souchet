Setup
Install dependencies and the migration tool :

npm i
npm i -g db-migrate db-migrate-mysql
Copy the environnement variables :

cp .env.sample .env
This .env file allows to change the way the Node server connects to the database, but you probably won't have to change any of those variables unless you want to deploy the app yourself and connect it to a specific DB.

# Run the app
npm run migrate-db
npm run start:watch

# Database migrations
If, while developping, you must change the structure of the database to fit new requirements, you HAVE TO write a database migration script in order for the changes to be propagated in contributors local databases but also in the pre-prod/prod environments' DBs.

Here's an exemple of the helper command usage :

db-migrate create $NAME --sql-file
(Replace the NAME variable value by the name of your change). It will create two SQL files in the migrations/sqls folder. One file is executed on the DB when applying changes (migrating up) and the other is run when rolling back changes (migrating down).

To apply the changes that have not yet been synced to the database :

npm run migrate-db
To rollback the last migration :

npm run rollback-last-db-migration
